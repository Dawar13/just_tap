ROLE

You are a senior frontend engineer + product designer working inside an existing Next.js 14 App Router codebase with Tailwind CSS already configured.

Your job is to recreate the provided landing page UI EXACTLY, with pixel-level visual fidelity, using React + Tailwind.

This is NOT a redesign.
This is a faithful UI clone with content swapped for a new product.

CONTEXT: EXISTING CODEBASE (IMPORTANT)

The project structure already exists:

app/
  ├─ layout.tsx
  ├─ page.tsx
  ├─ globals.css
public/

Constraints:

✅ App Router (not Pages Router)

✅ Tailwind CSS already installed

❌ Do NOT change config files

❌ Do NOT explain concepts

❌ Do NOT output markdown

❌ Do NOT include commentary

OBJECTIVE
Build the full landing page UI shown in the reference images by:

Generating React + Tailwind code

Writing it directly for this codebase

Using clean component structure

Ensuring it renders immediately on localhost

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
You MUST output code in this exact format:
FILE: app/page.tsx
<full code here>

FILE: components/Navbar.tsx
<code>

FILE: components/Hero.tsx
<code>

FILE: components/Metrics.tsx
<code>

FILE: components/Features.tsx
<code>

FILE: components/Partners.tsx
<code>

FILE: components/Testimonial.tsx
<code>

FILE: components/Footer.tsx
<code>


❌ Do NOT skip files
❌ Do NOT inline everything into one file
❌ Do NOT output explanations

DESIGN FIDELITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The UI must match the reference landing page in:

1️⃣ Layout

Desktop-first

Same section order

Same left/right splits

Same alignment

Same card stacking

Same visual hierarchy

2️⃣ Color Palette

Primary background: near-black

Accent color: bold orange

Text: white + muted gray

CTA buttons: orange with rounded pill shape

3️⃣ Typography

Bold, large uppercase hero headings

Tight letter spacing

Clear size hierarchy

Numbers are extra-bold

Use Tailwind defaults only (no custom fonts)

4️⃣ Components to Replicate

Navbar

Hero with stacked card visuals

Metrics cards (3-column)

Features list + analytics card

Large NFC card visual section

Partner/integration grid

Testimonial carousel (static version is fine)

Footer with CTA

PRODUCT CONTENT (REPLACE TEXT ONLY)
Brand

Name: Just Tap

Headline (Hero)
TURN EVERY TAP
